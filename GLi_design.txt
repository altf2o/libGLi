[ HEADER ]
  Total header size = 79 bytes (GLI_HEADER_SIZE in GLi.h)
  
mBytes   - This is what tells us if our file is a valid GLi image.
           It MUST be: 0x7F, 'G', 'L', 'i' (MAGIC_BYTES in GLi.h)
version  - This holds the current version of our GLi image. Right now this
           MUST be: 1 (one) (GLI_CURRENT_VERSION in GLi.h)
format   - This holds an OpenGL value that specifies the format our pixel
           data is in. Ex: RGB, RGBA, etc... Currently it can be one of the
           following values:
           GLI_FORMAT_STANDARD \ GLI_FORMAT_32BIT \ GLI_FORMAT_8BIT
           all defined in GLi.h.
           (NOTE: GLi pixel data is ALWAYS tightly (byte) packed)
width    - This specifies the images width in pixels.
height   - This specifies the images height in pixels.
pxlDepth - This specifies how many bits per pixel (bpp) our image has. The
           value is ALWAYS in bytes. Ex: 24bpp, pxlDepth = 3 (bytes).
author   - This is an array of characters that will hold a valid C-string 
           containing the authors name or identifying mark.
stamp    - This is an array of characters that will hold a valid C-string that
           contains a date and or time stamp. The format of that string is
           up to the author.
comp     - If this is: GLI_IMAGE_COMPRESSED then we have compressed image data.
           For ALL other values we assume raw uncompressed pixel data. (NOTE:
           If compression is /NOT/ used this will be initialized to: 
           GLI_IMAGE_NOTCOMPRESSED)
compSize - If 'comp' is: GLI_IMAGE_COMPRESSED then this will tell us how many 
           bytes our compressed data is. (NOTE: If compression is /NOT/ used
           this should be set to 0 (zero).)
           
[ IMAGE DATA ]

image    - This is where the actual image data goes. It's size for 
           uncompressed images will be 'imgSize', otherwise (for compressed
           images) it's, 'compSize'. (All in bytes)
