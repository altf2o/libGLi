* libGLi_src/libGLi.c (gli_load): Changed the logic in a test, to test for the
  most /expected/ condition. It helped make the flow more obvious, and removed
  a conditional call to 'free' at the end of the code.
  
* libGLi_src/libGLi.c (gli_compress): Re-arranged the way the call to the 
  'compress2' function looks.
  
* libGLi_src/libGLi.c (gli_uncompress): Re-arranged the way the call to the
  'uncompress' function looks.
  
* libGLi_src/libGLi.c (gli_writeOGLBuffer): Re-arranged the way i called the
  'gli_compress' function.
  
* ALL *.h,*.c files: Added a "File ID:" (given by subversion) for every source
  and header file, in the comment header of each file.
